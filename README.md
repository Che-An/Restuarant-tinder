**IMPORTANT NOTES for GRADER**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----> p.s. thank you so much for a great quarter & grading our project!

**GRADING INFO**
**1) Why are we submitting this github repo instead of a glitch project?**
- because our project got **suspended** by Glitch at June 6th evening around 9pm for "Violating Terms of Service" for unknown reasons. We don't have access to our code/project on glitch anymore and switeched back to developing locally. IT IS A LOT OF CODE THAT WAS LOST! We started early and were on track to finish on time, but we had to rewrite huge chunk of our code again locally due to the glitch suspension.
- We notified the professor via both email and piazza post @1733 (https://piazza.com/class/k8eo96o9a0w1xn?cid=1733)
- Professor gave us permission to submit a github link instead via the email reply. 
- We emailed Glitch support but they still haven't gotten back to us :(
- The glitch project is still suspended as of 6/7/2020 6PM. Project link: https://tinder-project.glitch.me/

**2) Why is our design different from Design Spec?**
- We started developing the project before it was announced that design spec for Tinder Project will be provided. We were pretty far down the road already, so professor told us to submit our design via the "Yearbook design" assignment on Canvas to get approval, in piazza post @1290(https://piazza.com/class/k8eo96o9a0w1xn?cid=1290)
- The Design TA, Emily, told us that we can continue to use our design via comment section under the "Yearbook design" assignment's submission.

**HOW TO TEST/PLAY WITH OUR PROJECT**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------







**Notes for the team:**
- Make sure you have either "yarn" or "npm" installed (these are package managers)
- If this is your first time cloning the project to your local env, make sure you do "yarn install" or "npm install" first to download all the dependencies.
- To start the project locally
- 1. run "node server.js" to start the server
- 2. run "yarn start" or "npm start" in terminal (make sure you do this in the project directory)
** MAKE SURE you restart the server each time so the DB will be dropped/created correctly **
