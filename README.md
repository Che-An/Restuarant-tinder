**Important notes for grader:** ----> p.s. thank you so much for a great quarter & grading our project!

**GRADING INFO**
**1) Why are we submitting this github repo instead of a glitch project?**
- because our project got **suspended** by Glitch at June 6th evening around 9pm for "Violating Terms of Service" for unknown reasons. We don't have access to our code/project on glitch anymore and switeched back to developing locally. IT IS A LOT OF CODE THAT WAS LOST! We started early and were on track to finish on time, but we had to rewrite huge chunk of our code again locally due to the glitch suspension.
- We notified the professor via both email and piazza post @1733 (https://piazza.com/class/k8eo96o9a0w1xn?cid=1733)
- Professor gave us permission to submit a github link instead via the email reply. 
- We emailed Glitch support but they still haven't gotten back to us :(
- The glitch project is still suspended as of 6/7/2020 6PM. Project link: https://tinder-project.glitch.me/

**2) Why is our design different from Design Spec?**
- We started developing the project before it was announced that design spec for Tinder Project will be provided. We were pretty far down the road already, so professor told us to submit our design via the "Yearbook design" assignment on Canvas to get approval, in piazza post @1290(https://piazza.com/class/k8eo96o9a0w1xn?cid=1290)
- The Design TA, Emily, told us that we can continue to use our design via comment section under the "Yearbook design" assignment's submission.

**HOW TO TEST/PLAY WITH OUR PROJECT**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Notes for the team:**
- Make sure you have either "yarn" or "npm" installed (these are package managers)
- If this is your first time cloning the project to your local env, make sure you do "yarn install" or "npm install" first to download all the dependencies.
- To start the project locally and see it in browser, run "yarn start" or "npm start" in terminal (make sure you do this in the project directory)\

** When adding code, make sure you branch off from master to a seperate branch -> write code on it -> push your branch to remote origin when you're done -> submit a merge/pull request
** DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO MASTER.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run: (`yarn install` before all of the following)

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node server.js`

do it at the same time of year start

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
